# Srcset Calculator
This tool was created as a shortcut for calculating the correct dimensions for my preferred HTML srcset intervals (**1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x**). 

It supports calculation of all interval values at any of the included breakpoints. The results will be calculated based on your selection of the original dimension scale. The script will also output a block of placeholder markup for rapid development

# usage
Lets say you have an image which is **2x** larger than its intended display size:

1. Enter the **Original Width** of the image in pixels.
2. Enter the **Original Height** of the image in pixels.
3. Select **2x** from the **Original Srcset Scale** drowpdown.
4. Win.

Feel free to modify or improve this script as you see fit, I imagine that this code will become deprecated as the industry moves forward regarding pixel density solutions.
